## Key Features

- **Unified AI SDK**: Built on top of Vercel's AI SDK for consistent AI interactions
- **OpenRouter Integration**: Access multiple LLMs through a single API
- **Server Actions**: Type-safe AI operations with Next.js server actions
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time AI responses with streaming capabilities
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for AI operations
- **RAG Support**: Built-in Retrieval Augmented Generation capabilities
- **Embeddings**: Text embeddings and semantic search functionality
- **Custom Models**: Extensible model registry for custom AI providers

## Getting Started

To start using AI features in your application:

1. Set up your environment variables
2. Configure OpenRouter
3. Use the AI SDK components
4. Implement server actions for AI operations

## Available AI Features

### Basic Features
- Chat interfaces
- Text generation
- Image generation
- Structured data extraction

### Advanced Features
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Semantic search with embeddings
- Custom model integration
- Advanced streaming with progress tracking
- Circuit breaker and retry patterns

## Architecture

The AI integration follows a modular architecture:

```
lib/ai/
├── openrouter.ts     # OpenRouter client
├── sdk.ts           # AI SDK configuration
├── embeddings.ts    # Text embeddings
├── rag.ts          # RAG implementation
├── vector-store.ts  # Vector storage
└── models/         # Custom model implementations
```

## Best Practices

1. **Model Selection**
   - Choose models based on your use case
   - Consider cost and performance trade-offs
   - Use the most efficient model for your needs

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Use retry logic for transient failures
   - Monitor API usage and errors

3. **Performance**
   - Use streaming for long-running operations
   - Implement proper caching strategies
   - Monitor response times and costs

4. **Security**
   - Validate all inputs and outputs
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Monitor for abuse and rate limiting
