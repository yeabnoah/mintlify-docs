# Environment Variables

:::info
The `@/web` app typically only requires public environment variables (prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`). For backend or sensitive variables, refer to the main project documentation or consult your backend team.
:::

- In most cases, you do **not** need to add custom `.env` variables for `@/web` unless integrating with external APIs or services directly from the frontend.
- If needed, create a `.env.local` file in `apps/web/` and add variables such as:

  ```env
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
  ```

- For backend or advanced configuration, refer to the main environment guide ([see here](../ENV_GUIDE.md)).
