# Environment Variables

> **Info:** The `@/web` app typically only requires public environment variables (prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`). For backend or sensitive variables, refer to the main project documentation or consult your backend team.

- In most cases, you do **not** need to add custom `.env` variables for `@/web` unless integrating with external APIs or services directly from the frontend.
- To set up environment variables, copy the `.env.example` file in `apps/web/` to a new file named `.env`:
  ```bash
  cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
  ```
- Edit `.env` to include variables such as:
  ```env
      NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3001
      NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
  ```

- **Note:** If your CMS is running on a different route or port (by default it runs on [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003)), you must set `PAYLOAD_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` in your `.env` file to the correct URL. For example:
  ```env
  PAYLOAD_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3003
  ```

- For backend or advanced configuration, refer to the main environment guide.
