# CMS & Content Integration

The web app supports dynamic content through CMS integration and content components.

---

## CMS Service (`@/services/cms/cms.ts`)

Provides utilities for fetching blog posts and privacy policy content.

**Usage Example:**

```ts
import { cmsService } from "@/services/cms/cms";

// Fetch latest blogs
const blogs = await cmsService.blogs.getLatest(3);

// Fetch privacy policy
const policy = await cmsService.privacy.getPolicy();
```

---

## Content Components (`@/features/content/`)

- **Blog:** Render blog posts and lists.
- **Privacy:** Render privacy policy content.
- **Shared:** Typography, skeletons, and more.

**Example:**

```tsx
import Blog from "@/features/content/blog/blog";
<Blog post={post} />
```

---

## Content Pages (`(content)/`)

- **Blogs:** `/blogs` and `/blogs/[id]` for blog listings and detail pages.
- **Privacy Policy:** `/privacy-policy` for privacy content.
