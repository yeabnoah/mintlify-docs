```

**Folder Descriptions:**

- **apps/web/src/app/(content)/blogs/**: Contains the dynamic route pages for individual blog posts, rendering content fetched from the CMS or local sources.
- **apps/web/src/app/(content)/privacy-policy/**: Holds the privacy policy pages, allowing for easy updates and dynamic rendering of legal content.
- **apps/web/src/app/(content)/layout.tsx**: Provides the layout wrapper for all content-related pages, ensuring consistent structure and styling.

- **apps/web/src/features/content/blog/**: Contains feature logic, components, and utilities specifically for blog functionality (e.g., fetching, displaying, and managing blog posts).
- **apps/web/src/features/content/privacy/**: Handles privacy policy logic and components, such as fetching and rendering privacy-related content.
- **apps/web/src/features/content/shared/**: Houses shared utilities and components used across different content features (e.g., markdown renderers, content formatters).

## CMS Service (`@/services/cms/cms.ts`)

Provides utilities for fetching blog posts and privacy policy content.

**Usage Example:**

```ts
import { cmsService } from "@/services/cms/cms";

// Fetch latest blogs
const blogs = await cmsService.blogs.getLatest(3);

// Fetch privacy policy
const policy = await cmsService.privacy.getPolicy();
```

## Content Components (`@/features/content/`)

- **Blog:** Render blog posts and lists.
- **Privacy:** Render privacy policy content.
- **Shared:** Typography, skeletons, and more.

**Example:**

```tsx
import Blog from "@/features/content/blog/blog";
<Blog post={post} />
```

### Rich Text Rendering Utility (`render-rich-text.tsx`)

Your CMS uses a custom utility at `apps/web/src/lib/render-rich-text.tsx` to render rich text content from a Lexical-compatible JSON structure into React components.

**Key Features:**
- Supports headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and inline text formatting (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough).
- Input: Expects a tree of `LexicalNode` objects (see the `LexicalNode` type in the file).
- Output: Returns React elements with Tailwind CSS classes for consistent styling.

**Usage Example:**
```tsx
import { renderRichText } from "@/lib/render-rich-text";

// `content` is a Lexical JSON node tree (from your CMS/editor)
export default function ArticleBody({ content }) {
  return <div>{renderRichText(content)}</div>;
}
```

**How It Works:**
- Text nodes: Rendered as `<span>` with formatting classes.
- Headings: Rendered as `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` with anchor IDs for linking.
- Paragraphs: Rendered as `<p>` with spacing and leading.
- Lists: Rendered as `<ul>`/`<li>` with proper indentation.
- Links: Rendered as `<a>` with external link handling.
- Empty nodes: Skipped or rendered as empty divs for spacing.
