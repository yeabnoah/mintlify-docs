# Example App Pages

This doc covers the built-in example pages—**AI** and **Todos**—provided as rapid prototyping templates in the Ultimate Boilerplate. These pages are designed to be starting points for new features or apps, demonstrating best practices for integrating with the core stack.

## AI Example Page (`/dashboard/ai`)

- **Purpose:**
  - Demonstrates how to build an interactive AI chat experience using the boilerplate's stack.
  - Showcases prompt handling, chat UI, and integration with an AI API endpoint.
- **How to use as a template:**
  - Copy the page and adapt the chat logic for your own AI-powered features (e.g., support bots, code assistants, etc.).
  - Extend the prompt list, customize the UI, or swap out the AI backend as needed.
- **Extensibility:**
  - Add new message types, streaming, or custom AI workflows.
  - Integrate with other backend APIs or business logic.

## Todos Example Page (`/dashboard/todos`)

- **Purpose:**
  - Provides a full CRUD example for managing a simple list of todos.
  - Demonstrates optimistic UI updates, mutation patterns, and state management.
- **How to use as a template:**
  - Use as a starting point for any CRUD-based feature (e.g., notes, tasks, projects).
  - Replace the data model and API calls to fit your use case.
- **Extensibility:**
  - Add filtering, sorting, or more complex data relationships.
  - Integrate with authentication, notifications, or external APIs.

## Best Practices
- Use these example pages as blueprints for new features.
- Keep business logic in feature components for reusability.
- Follow the patterns shown for data fetching, mutation, and UI feedback.
