## AI Example Page (`/dashboard/ai`)

- **Purpose:**
  - Demonstrates how to build an interactive AI chat experience using the boilerplate's stack.
  - Showcases prompt handling, chat UI, and integration with an AI API endpoint.
- **How to use as a template:**
  - Copy the page and adapt the chat logic for your own AI-powered features (e.g., support bots, code assistants, etc.).
  - Extend the prompt list, customize the UI, or swap out the AI backend as needed.
- **Extensibility:**
  - Add new message types, streaming, or custom AI workflows.
  - Integrate with other backend APIs or business logic.

## Todos Example Page (`/dashboard/todos`)

- **Purpose:**
  - Provides a full CRUD example for managing a simple list of todos.
  - Demonstrates optimistic UI updates, mutation patterns, and state management.
- **How to use as a template:**
  - Use as a starting point for any CRUD-based feature (e.g., notes, tasks, projects).
  - Replace the data model and API calls to fit your use case.
- **Extensibility:**
  - Add filtering, sorting, or more complex data relationships.
  - Integrate with authentication, notifications, or external APIs.

## Best Practices
- Use these example pages as blueprints for new features.
- Keep business logic in feature components for reusability.
- Follow the patterns shown for data fetching, mutation, and UI feedback.
