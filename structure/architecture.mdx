## Monorepo Structure

```
apps/
├── web/           # Next.js frontend application
├── server/        # Backend server with tRPC + Hono
├── cms/          # Headless CMS
└── email/        # Email service
```

## Web Application Structure

The web application (`apps/web`) follows a feature-based architecture:

```
src/
├── app/              # Next.js App Router pages
├── components/       # Reusable UI components
├── features/         # Feature-specific components and logic
├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks
├── layouts/         # Next.js layouts
├── lib/             # Core utilities and configurations
├── services/        # API and external service integrations
├── stores/          # State management
├── styles/          # Global styles and Tailwind config
├── types/           # TypeScript type definitions
└── utils/           # Helper functions and utilities
```

### Key Directories

#### `app/`
- Contains all Next.js pages and layouts
- Follows the App Router convention
- Includes route handlers and API endpoints

#### `components/`
- Shared UI components
- Organized by type (ui, layout, forms, etc.)
- Includes shadcn/ui components

#### `features/`
- Feature-specific components and logic
- Each feature is self-contained
- Includes business logic and UI components

#### `services/`
- API client configurations
- External service integrations
- tRPC client setup

## Server Structure

The server application (`apps/server`) follows a clean architecture pattern:

```
src/
├── controllers/     # Request handlers
├── lib/            # Core utilities
├── routers/        # tRPC routers
├── services/       # Business logic
└── utils/          # Helper functions
```

### Key Components

#### `controllers/`
- Business logic implementation
- Handles incoming requests
- Input validation
- Response formatting

#### `routers/`
- tRPC router definitions
- API endpoint organization
- Middleware configuration

#### `services/`
- Database operations
- External service integrations

## Database Architecture

The project uses Prisma with Supabase (PostgreSQL):

```
prisma/
├── schema.prisma    # Database schema
└── migrations/      # Database migrations
```

## Authentication Flow

The authentication system uses BetterAuth:

1. User initiates auth (email, OAuth)
2. BetterAuth handles the flow
3. Session is created and stored
4. User metadata is synced to database

## API Architecture

The API layer uses tRPC for type-safe communication:

1. Frontend makes type-safe API calls
2. tRPC router processes the request
3. Controller handles the business logic
4. Response is returned to the client

## State Management

- React Context for global state
- Zustand for complex state management
- Server state handled by tRPC

## Styling Architecture

- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- shadcn/ui for component library
- CSS Modules for component-specific styles
- Dark mode support built-in
