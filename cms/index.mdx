# 🚀 Get Started with Your CMS

Welcome to the **CMS** section of our project! 👋

This guide will walk you through setting up the Content Management System (CMS). Out of the box, your CMS comes pre-configured with **Posts** and a **Privacy Policy**—so you can start managing content immediately. For instructions on running the rest of the project, please refer to the main documentation. Let's get your CMS up and running quickly.

## ⚡️ Setting Up the CMS

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd apps/cms
   bun install # or: pnpm install
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Database**

   :::tip
   The CMS requires a PostgreSQL database. We recommend [Supabase](https://app.supabase.com/) (free), but you can use any Postgres instance.
   :::

   - [Database setup instructions →](/database/cms-setup)

3. **Configure Database Connection**

   Open `.env` and set the `DATABASE_URL` to your Supabase or Postgres connection string.

4. **Start the CMS**

   ```bash
   bun turbo run dev --filter cms
   # or: pnpm turbo run dev --filter cms
   ```

5. **Access the CMS**

   Open [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003) in your browser.

   Your CMS will be live on port 3003! 🎉

  ```bash
  openssl rand -hex 32
  ```
