## API Types

Our API is organized into three main types of routes:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card
    title="Public Routes"
    icon="globe"
    href="/docs/api/public"
  >
    Routes accessible without authentication for public data access, health checks, and authentication endpoints.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Protected Routes"
    icon="lock"
    href="/docs/api/protected"
  >
    Routes requiring user authentication for user-specific data, profile management, and personal settings.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Subscribed Routes"
    icon="star"
    href="/docs/api/subscribed"
  >
    Routes requiring an active subscription for premium features and subscription-gated content.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
