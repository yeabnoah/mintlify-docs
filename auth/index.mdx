  > **Note:** The setup guides below explain how we configured the boilerplate. You don't need to perform these steps yourself.

## Features

- üîê Multiple Authentication Methods
  - Email & Password
  - Social Providers (Google)
  - Email Verification
  - Password Reset Flow
- üí≥ Payment Integration (Stripe & Polar.sh)
- üõ°Ô∏è Protected Routes
- üîí Session Management

## Quick Start

1. Set up environment variables: in the .env file in `apps/server`

```env
# Auth Configuration
AUTH_SECRET="your-auth-secret"
CORS_ORIGIN="http://localhost:3001"

# OAuth Providers
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"

# Email (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY="your-resend-api-key"
```

setup in the .env file in `apps/web`

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3001
```





2. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun add better-auth @better-auth/stripe @polar-sh/better-auth
```

## Authentication Methods

### Email & Password

The boilerplate supports traditional email and password authentication with:

- Email verification
- Password reset flow
- Secure password hashing
- Rate limiting

### Social Providers

Currently supported social providers:

- Google OAuth
- More providers coming soon

## Protected Routes

The boilerplate includes middleware for protecting routes:

```typescript
// middleware.ts
export const config = {
  matcher: [
    "/dashboard/:path*",
    "/settings/:path*",
    "/api/protected/:path*",
  ],
};
```

## Integration with Payments

Authentication is integrated with payment providers:

- Polar.sh (primary)
- Stripe (fallback)
- Subscription management
- Customer portal

## Security Best Practices

1. **Password Security**
   - Strong password hashing
   - Rate limiting
   - Password complexity requirements

2. **Session Security**
   - Secure session storage
   - Session timeout
   - CSRF protection
   - Secure cookies

3. **OAuth Security**
   - Token validation
   - State parameter
   - Secure client secrets
